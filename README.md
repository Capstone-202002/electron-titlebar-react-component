## react-electron-titlebar-component

#### You can use it in any React component, it does not have any layout restrictions, you can place it anywhere. It is just a React component.

#### It can be used in the web and electronics, but when it is used in the web, there is no window function, such as: maximize, minimize, restore.

##### This package uses part of the code of [react-custom-electron-titlebar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-custom-electron-titlebar), but I don't need a complete titlebar, only a few buttons, and provide window functions.

##### What the component looked like initially

```jsx
<div>
  <TitlebarWid style={{ background: '#3a3a3a' }} />
  <TitlebarMac style={{ background: '#3f51b5' }} />
</div>
```

![titlebar](./img/titlebar.png)

##### You can put the component in any position and assemble it to your favorite, such as the following.
