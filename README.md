## react-electron-titlebar-component

#### You can use it in any React component, it does not have any layout restrictions, you can place it anywhere. It is just a React component.

This package uses part of the code of [react-custom-electron-titlebar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-custom-electron-titlebar), but the simpler pages I need are more free.
